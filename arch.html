                        Oh, you "use arch BTW." Do you expect a Reddit gold? Naw, I ain't no kind stranger. If you brag about your operating system online, then I can't even imagine how much of an asshole you are in real life. Great, you know how to read a fucking manual, and you know basic English. Jesus fucking Christ, you arch-kiddies are so toxic saying "I use Arch BTW" as if it's tough to install. Oh wow you're typing simple commands into a fucking tty. You do realize that Arch Linux is just a binary distro, that uses systemD (a shitty init system for n00bs). The Arch Linux community is full of edgy 15 year olds who act like they're superior. If you actually want to learn the inner workings of Linux, you should use Gentoo. Gentoo is a source based distro with OpenRC (an actually decent init system), that is actually hard to install. There is no manual for Gentoo, so you actually have to use critical thinking skills instead of copying and pasting commands into a tty. For Gentoo you have to fine tune the system to your exact hardware instead of just running "pacstrap" like a n00b on an archiso. It takes a long time to install Gentoo. It took an entire decade to compile the kernel from a stage 1 tarball onto my IBM Thinkpad 69420 (bought from my local used-thinkpad-store for 10 cents) with and the Core i-21 ultra-supreme extra-spicy CPU literally turned into ionized plasma and burnt my entire neighboorhood to the ground and the kernel took an entire decade to compile. After that I had to manually write the wifi-driver in ed ( a good text editor ) and compile them with -O7 gcc compiling flags. After the entire installaton I booted up the Gentoo installation and it used an entire 1 kilobyte less of RAM than Arch Linux. Arch-kiddies like you wouldn't have the patience to compile Gentoo. The Gentoo community is very nice and humble and doesn't brag about their OS (unlike you elitist assholes). So instead of saying "I use Arch BTW", just shut the fuck up!!!
